# Vulnerability Assessment for E-commerce Company

## Scenario
I am a newly hired cybersecurity analyst for an e-commerce company. The company stores information on a remote database server, since many of the employees work remotely from locations all around the world. Employees of the company regularly query, or request, data from the server to find potential customers. The database has been open to the public since the company's launch three years ago. As a cybersecurity professional, I recognize that keeping the database server open to the public is a serious vulnerability.

## Objective
To complete a vulnerability assessment of the situation, communicate the potential risks to decision-makers at the company, and provide a remediation plan to secure the vulnerable server.

## Conclusion

This vulnerability assessment highlights the significant risks associated with maintaining an open public database server as well as it helps to get hands on practice with building a vulnerability assessment report.
