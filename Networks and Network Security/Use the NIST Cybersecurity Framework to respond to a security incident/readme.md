In this activity, I created an incident report using the knowledge about networks obtained during the Google cybersecurity course to analyze a network incident. I analyze a situation using the National Institute of Standards and Technology's Cybersecurity Framework (NIST CSF). The CSF is a voluntary framework that consists of standards, guidelines, and best practices to manage cybersecurity risk. Creating a quality cybersecurity incident report and applying the CSF can demonstrate a proactive approach to security, improving communication and transparency with stakeholders, and improve security practices within your organization.

The CSF is scalable and can be applied in a wide variety of contexts. Knowing how to identify which security measures to apply in response to business needs helps determine which are the best available options when it comes to network security.

The scenario is at the end of pdf file.
