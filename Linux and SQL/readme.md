The in this folder were developed during the fourth course in the Google Cybersecurity Certificate.

In this course, I explored computing skills that are used on-the-job as a cybersecurity analyst. First, using Linux, an operating system commonly used by cybersecurity professionals. For example, using Linux command line through the Bash shell to navigate and manage the file system and authenticate users. Then, SQL to communicate with a database. 

By the end of this course, the skills learned were: 
- Explain the relationship between operating systems, applications, and hardware.
- Compare a graphical user interface to a command line interface.
- Identify the unique features of common Linux distributions.
- Navigate and manage the file system using Linux commands via the Bash shell.
- Use Linux commands via the Bash shell to authenticate and authorize users.
- Describe how a relational database is organized.
- Use SQL to retrieve information from a database.
- Apply filters to SQL queries and use joins to combine multiple tables.
